ChatGPT. 

_Who is that Chatt Gepetto guy?_ Asks granny, the last person on Earth who hears about it. By now it's all over Twitter, YouTube and prime time news. 

Every influencer and wannabe talks about ChatGPT. How to dig gold with it. How everybody can produce content without having the a clue what are they talking about. _I keep hearing that real-estate guy laughing "Look at this shit!" while he is copying from ChatGPT the script for a Udemy course on AI._ Yes indeed, look at this shit! 

They're using it to: 
* create articles and ebooks
* make scripts for short 10 facts YouTube videos and whole Udemy courses
* generate copy that ranks higher on Google
* write esseys and pass exams
* brainstorm ideas, names and slogans
* write tweets, jokes and limericks
* bootstrap AI businesses that put a shiny website over ChatGPT API 
* generate code, unit tests, JSONs, YAMLs, even SVGs
* create absolutely everthing that is in text form!

Of course there are people  - like me - who are appalled by this trend. I'm horrified that next year this time I'll see only syntetic content everywhere. I'm horrified that I will not be able to tell if is syntetic or not. Hopefully browsers will have a built-in detection by then. 

Outnumbered and outgunned, we  have to grind on.

_But!_, you ask, _Is ChatCPT any good?_ Oh yes, it's good. But there is a catch.

I've used it last night to solve some mathematical limits using diferential derivates. I've used it to write the missing part of the lost [`The Book of Programming`](https://gist.github.com/jescalan/d0866e7c12e9d0d8fa15) by Master Yuan-Ma, here's a snippet:

> A symphony of code, a symphony of thought, \
> A masterpiece of engineering, a problem to be fought. \
> A journey through the machine, a quest to solve, \
> A symphony of logic, a story to evolve. 

But mostly, I've explored how ChatGPT can help me do my job as a `web developer`.

_If it's that good, will it replace us developers?_

_I bet you're biting your nails that you sold that `NVDA` stock when the crypto crashed. Guess what, this whole AI bonanza is powered by NVIDIA GPUs too._
