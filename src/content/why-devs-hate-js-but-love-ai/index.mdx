description: One of the greatest paradoxes of our time is that developers hate JavaScript but love AI. How can that be? Why nobody realises that the curse of JavaScript has beed cast on AI too?

For a long time, JavaScript has been the bane of many developers' existence. 
It's a language that often feels like it was designed to be difficult, with all its quirks and inconsistencies. 
But what can you expect from a language that was cobbled together in just 10 days? 
And yet, despite its many flaws, I am one of those weirdos who actually love JavaScript. 
This is because, in time, I have learned to avoid its foot guns and bad parts, and I have come to appreciate its flexibility and expressiveness.

But unlike me, many developers, especially those coming from other programming languages - that were designed and refined in decades - find JavaScript to be a frustrating little language. 
JavaScript problems were exacerbated by the "Browser Wars" between big corpos, when different browsers implemented different features and standards instead of working together to fix the problems.
And thus the curse of JavaScript was cast upon the web devs, creating a language that is both powerful and maddening.

The solution was to create JavaScript frameworks and libraries that try to hide the language and the browser inconsistencies under a thick layer of abstraction.
Until recently, almost each month, a shiny new JS framework or library was released, promising to make web development easier and more enjoyable. 
We were rewriting our codebases every few months, chasing the latest and brightest, only to find that our web pages loaded a ton of JavaScript code that was not even used, frustrating the few users who managed to load them.

And then, AI came along.
The tech bros moved to praise the AI, leaving behind JavaScript and its problems. 
The JavaScript community is finally taking a break from the never-ending cycle of new frameworks and libraries. 
The curse is lifted, and remaining JavaScript developers are free to focus on building applications that actually work, instead of trying to keep up with the latest trends.

The thing is that AI is not immune to the same problems that plague JavaScript:
- Before it seamed easy to write JavaScript code that works, now it seams easy to write a prompt that makes AI do what you want. It is not.
- Before we had to chase the latest JavaScript framework, now we have to chase the latest AI model.
- Before we were worried about the carbon footprint of our web pages, now we are worried about the carbon footprint of our AI queries.
- Before we created a lot of poor websites, now we create a lot of AI slop.

So why the same developers who hate JavaScript are now in love with AI?

Here are top 10 reasons:

1. AI is the new get rich quick scheme 
Lots of people think that AI is the magic bullet that will make them rich.
Long gone are the days when they were trying to sell you a "revolutionary" JavaScript framework that will change the way you build web applications.
Crypto and NFT bros and the rest of proffesional BS sellers have moved to AI, and they are now trying to sell you the next big thing in AI.
You can hear them say things like:
- "I can make money without actually doing anything"
- "I can automate my job and make money while I sleep"
- "I can create a startup that will make millions with AI"
- "I'm an AI influencer and make money from sponsorships"
- "I'm an AI guru and sell courses on how to use AI"
- "I'm an AI consultant and charge a lot of money for my services"

2. AI is new and shiny, and they want views and likes 
Attention spans are getting shorter, nobody has the patience to read a long article or watch a long video about JavaScript.
JavaScript influencers and content creators are jumping on the AI bandwagon, trying to get views and likes by creating mass-market fast-food AI-related content.
Over night everyone is an AI expert with 10 years of experience in last month AI. 
All play the same buzzword bingo game, using phrases like:
- AI Mastery, 
- How this changes everything, 
- The future of coding, 
- The AI hack they don't want you to know, 
- This is amazing,
- New MPC toolkit is insane, 
- Code 10x faster,
- AI agents explained,
- I found the best AI for coding

3. Vibe coding
People are not interested in coding anymore, they just want running software. 
JavaScript or not, it doesn't matter, as long as they can get the code they need without having to understand it.
They are the new proffesional vibe coders. 
- Their most frequent AI query is "Fix it now or you go to jail please"
- In this new world, there are no code errors, just mood misallignments
- There is no technical debt, because these people are not technical anymore
- Typing code manually is what only psychopaths do, as they don't feel the vibe 


4. Can blame the AI for their mistakes 
-  "the AI did it, not me"

5. People are lazy 
- they don't want to put in the effort,
- they just want to use AI to do it for them

6. Afraid of being left behind 
- "everyone is using AI, I have to use it too"
- FOMO
- "if I don't use AI, I will be obsolete"
- "if I don't use AI, I will lose my job"
- they risk being kicked out of the cool kids club
- they don't necessarily like AI, but they feel they have to praise it to stay relevant in their bubble

7. Cargo cult mentality
- people are fascinated by the messianic aspect of futurism 
- "AI is the future, it will solve all our problems"
- "AI will save us from ourselves"
- "AI is just a magic box that does everything for me"

8. People are comfortably numb
- these people are devs by mistake, they lack any passion or interest in their work, they just drone on
- these people are not interested in learning or improving their skills, they don't care about the quality or the performance of their code
- they would rather scroll through TikTok or watch YouTube cat videos than actually write any code
- these people are devising ways to reach AI query limits as soon as possible, so they can go home early  

9. Someone to talk with 
- rubber duck that responds
- "AI is my friend, it listens to me and understands me"
- devs are introverts that lack any social skills and AI is a great way to interact with others without having to leave their comfort zone
- no more impostor syndrome, because AI is always there to help them
- they can invent virtual partners

10. Not aware of the dark side of AI
- brain rot
- you use AI to write code until you forget how to write code
- you blindly trust AI to write code for you, until you forget how to think for yourself
- you end up with nasty bugs that you can't fix, because you don't understand the code
- you end up with a so much AI slop that maintaining it becomes a nightmare
- you'll want to change your job, but you can't, because you don't know how to answer the interview questions

So, while JavaScript may be the bane of many developers' existence, AI is hardly the solution they dream of.
Just like JavaScript, AI is can be both powerful and maddening.
The curse of JavaScript has been cast upon AI too, if we are not careful we end up in the same rabbit hole. 
Only this time, the hole is deeper and darker.
