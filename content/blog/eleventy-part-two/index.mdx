This is the second part of *Let's Learn Eleventy* series and will talk about collections.
In the [first part](/eleventy-part-one/) we have seen:
* What is Eleventy and how to install it
* How to use data inside a page
* Basic configuration
* Using the same template in multiple pages

## What is a collection in 11ty?
A collection is a group of content pieces. 

For example a blog has a posts collection, a landing page has a testimonials collection, a portfolio is a collection of showcases. 

### Tip
Before we begin, I want to share a debugging tip. 
It can be very useful to have a way of inspecting the collections or an item from 
a collection. Today, 11ty comes with a `dump` filter for this purpose but it doesn't work in some cases.
We need to overwrite it by creating our own `dump` filter inside the `.eleventy.js` config:
```js
const util = require('util');

module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
    //..
    
    eleventyConfig.addFilter('dump', obj => {
        return util.inspect(obj)
    });

    // ...
}  
```

In a page you can do:
```markdown
{% set items = [1, 2, 3] %}
{{ items | dump }}

{{ collection.portfolio | dump }}
```



## Group content with tags
The simplest way to create a collection is by setting the same tag to all the content pieces that must be in 
the collection.

If you have a portfolio page where you want to show your work, create a folder called `portfolio` and create a 
markdown file for each of your portfolio item (it doesn't really matter where you put the files, but it's nice
to organize the content a bit).

restaurant.md
```markdown
---
title: Restaurant website
description: Allow clients to make reservations online
tags: portfolio
---
```

shop.md
```markdown
---
title: Shop website
description: Local shop website, allowed them to survive during lockdown
tags: portfolio
---
```

travel.md
```markdown
---
title: Travel website
description: Travel agency website, complex location search and recomandations
tags: portfolio
---
```
All these files have a `tag` set to `portfolio` and because of this, 11ty will create a portfolio colletion with them.

Now, on the page where you want to show them, e.g portfolio.md, you can do this:

portfolio.md
```markdown
{%- for portfolio in collections.portfolio -%}
  <article>
    <header>{{ portfolio.data.title }}</header>
    {{ portfolio.data.description }}    
  </article>
{%- endfor -%}
```

You might wonder how the items are sorted. 11ty docs say that:
> The default collection sorting algorithm sorts in ascending order using:
* The input file’s Created Date (you can override using date in front matter)
* Files created at the exact same time are tie-broken using the input file’s full path including filename

So the simplest way to make sure the items are sorted in the exact order you want, is to add `date` 
in each file frontmatter.

restaurant.md
```markdown
---
title: Restaurant website
date: 2020-01-01 
---
```

shop.md
```markdown
---
title: Shop website
date: 2020-01-03 
---
```

travel.md
```markdown
---
title: Travel website
date: 2020-01-02 
---
```
If you want them reversed, you can add `reversed` next to collection name:
```markdown
{%- for portfolio in collections.portfolio reversed -%}  
<article>
  <header>{{ portfolio.data.title }}</header>
</article>
{%- endfor -%}
```


### Multiple tags
You can use multiple tags with a single content and there are two ways to set it.

Single line:
```markdown
tags: ['portfolio', 'highlight']
```
Multiple lines:
```markdown
tags: 
    - 'portfolio'
    - 'highlight'
```
Now the same piece of content, will be present in two different collections.

Portfolio collection
```markdown
{%- for portfolio in collections.portfolio -%}  
  <header>{{ portfolio.data.title }}</header>
{%- endfor -%}
```

Highlight collection
```markdown
{%- for highlight in collections.highlight -%}  
  <header>{{ highlight.data.title }}</header>
{%- endfor -%}
```


### Exclude content from collection
If you want a piece of content to be excluded from a collection, use `eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true`
in frontmatter. For example, to exclude restaurant item you can do:

restaurant.md
```markdown
---
eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true  
title: Restaurant website
description: Allow clients to make reservations online
tags: portfolio
---
```
Now only the other two piece of content will be present in the portfolio collection.


## Custom collections
11ty puts all the content, with or withour tags, into the `collections.all` collection. 
This way you have access to all the content by iterating over a single collection.

We can use the `collection.all` to create our own collections by filtering and/or sorting
this collections inside the 11ty configuration file, `.eleventy.js`

We could have created the portfolio collection without tags, by using the fact that 
they are in the same folder, /portfolio:

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {

    eleventyConfig.addCollection("portfolio", function (collectionApi) {
        return collectionApi.getAllSorted()
            .filter(item => item.url
                && item.inputPath.startsWith('./portfolio'))
    });
}
```

Here is another example, how to create a collection with Top 3 highlights:
```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {

    // ...

    // collection with first top 3 portfolio highlights
    eleventyConfig.addCollection("top3", function (collectionApi) {
        // get content with highlight tag
        const highlights = collectionApi.getFilteredByTags('highlight');                
        // return first 3
        return highlights.slice(0, 3);
    });
}
```

## Global data
11ty has a special folder where you can put global data, by default this folder is `_data` ( but 
you can specify your own if you want in the .eleventy.js).

The global data can be objects or arrays. If an array is there, we can use it as a collection.

So another way to create the portfolio items is to create a `portfolio.json` inside the `_data` folder:
```json
[
    {
        "title": "Restaurant website",
        "description": "Allow clients to make reservations online"
    },
    {
        "title": "Shop website",
        "description": "Local shop website, allowed them to survive during lockdown"
    },
    {
        "title": "Travel website",
        "description": "Travel agency website, complex location search and recomandations"
    }
]
```
Inside a page we have access to `portfolio` data directly:
```markdown
{%- for item in portfolio -%}  
<article>
  <header>{{ item.title }}</header>
</article>
{%- endfor -%}
```
Two things to note here:
* use `portfolio` not `collections.portfolio`
* use `item.title` not `item.data.title`


## Recap
* Add tags to content and 11ty automatically creates collections
* Create custom collections by filtering and/or sorting existing collections
* Can use global data collections
