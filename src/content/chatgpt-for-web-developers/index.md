ChatGPT. 

_Who is that Chatt Gepetto guy?_ Asks granny, the last person on Earth who hears about ChatGPT. By now it's all over Twitter, YouTube and prime time news. 

Every influencer and wannabe talks about ChatGPT. How to dig gold with it. How everybody can produce content without having the a clue what are they talking about. _I keep hearing that real-estate guy laughing "Look at this shit!" while he is copying from ChatGPT the script for a Udemy course on AI._ Yes indeed, look at this shit! 

They're using it to: 
* create articles and ebooks
* make scripts for short 10 facts YouTube videos and whole Udemy courses
* generate copy that ranks higher on Google
* write esseys and pass exams
* brainstorm ideas, names and slogans
* write tweets, jokes and limericks
* bootstrap AI businesses that put a shiny website over ChatGPT API 
* generate code, unit tests, JSONs, YAMLs, even SVGs
* create absolutely everthing that is in text form!

Of course there are people  - like me - who are appalled by this trend. I'm horrified that next year this time I'll see only syntetic content everywhere. I'm horrified that I will not be able to tell if is syntetic or not. Hopefully browsers will have a built-in detection by then. In the meantime I'll keep asking: [Is There Anybody Out There?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIxYe3G3Iz4)

I don't think this AI hysteria will go away. Outnumbered and outgunned, we have to grind on. We have to adapt.
[Stack Overflow searches are down by 60%](https://twitter.com/flaviocopes/status/1620333315919331328?s=43&t=uSgftvbzL10aeP45t_vQSA) since ChatGPT was spawned. I wonder if Google sees a decrease in searches. 

_But!_, you ask, _Is ChatCPT any good?_ Oh yes, it's good. 
It's like having a `conversation` with Google Search. It's better then Google Search because (for now) there are no ads, no SEO-doctored content. It can respond in different styles, it can be who you want it to be. It's even better then a real person because it remembers the context and the progress of each "discussion" days after you started the conversation. Eerie. I would be very worried right now if I were Google. 

_I bet you're biting your nails that you sold that `NVDA` stock when the crypto crashed. Guess what, this whole AI bonanza is powered by NVIDIA GPUs too._

I've used it last night to solve some mathematical limits using diferential derivates. I've used it to write the missing parts of the lost [`The Book of Programming`](https://gist.github.com/jescalan/d0866e7c12e9d0d8fa15) by Master Yuan-Ma, here's a snippet:

> A symphony of code, a symphony of thought, \
> A masterpiece of engineering, a problem to be fought. \
> A journey through the machine, a quest to solve, \
> A symphony of logic, a story to evolve. 

But mostly, I've explored how ChatGPT can help me do my job as a web developer.

_If it's that good, will it replace us developers?_ Completely? No. Maybe some day it will, but it's not quite there yet. ChatGPT works best if you use it as a personal assistant. 

It can help a good programmer do the work in less time, so maybe a team of five people can now do the same work with only three or four people - one is now reduntant. It can also make us better "Full Stack" developers. I'm mostly a frontend developer, and more confortable when I work with a good backend developer. But now that ChatGPT is here, I don't now, I'm not so nervous when I have to do some backend too.

## The problem with ChatGPT

We like it or not, ChatGPT and it's older sibling, [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), will slowly gain traction in our little software development bubble. For better or worse, more and more code will be written with the help of AI. Some of it will be crap, some will be awesome, just like today, when is written without the iron hand of the AI.

The next 10x developer will have ChatGPT and Copilot as sidekicks. It might not even be a developer but a bored real-estate guy that wants to have a laugh. _Look at this shit!_

**The problem is clients/managers/businesses will expect us to be more _prolific_ and _effiecient_ because of ChatGPT & Copilot.**
